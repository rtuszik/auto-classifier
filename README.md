`Auto Classifier` is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that helps you automatically classify tags in your notes using either OpenAI-compatible APIs (ChatGPT, Ollama, LocalAI, etc.) or Jina AI Classifier. The plugin can analyze your note (including its title, frontmatter, content, or selected area) and suggest relevant tags based on the input with tags in your vault. This can be used for various specific purposes, for example, DDC classification for books, keyword recommendation, research paper categorization, and so on. Save time and improve your note organization.

## How to use

-   Configure your classification engine and API settings in the settings tab:

    -   **Choose your Classification Engine:**
        -   `OpenAI-compatible API`: Uses OpenAI API, Local AI (Ollama, LocalAI), or other compatible APIs
        -   `Jina AI`: Uses Jina AI Classifier (cost-effective, multilingual)
    
    -   **For OpenAI-compatible API:**
        -   Enter your API key (leave empty for local AI)
        -   Set the base URL:
            - OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1` (default)
            - Local OpenAI-compatible API (Ollama, LocalAI):
                - Ollama: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
                - LocalAI: `http://localhost:8080/v1`
        -   Choose your model:
            - OpenAI: `gpt-4.1-mini` (recommended), `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, ...
            - Local OpenAI-compatible API: `llama3`, `mistral`, `phi3`, `qwen2`, ... (Ollama/LocalAI)
        -   Test your configuration using the Test API call button
    
    -   **For Jina AI:**
        -   Enter your Jina AI API key (free tier available with 10M tokens)
        -   Choose your preferred model (default: jina-embeddings-v3)
        -   Test your configuration using the Test Jina API button 
        -   **Getting a Jina AI API Key**: Visit the [Jina AI website](https://jina.ai/) to obtain a free temporary API key (you can get the key without creating an account).

-   This plugin consists of **4 Input Commands** that you can run. By simply running these commands, it will automatically classify your note:

    -   `Classify tag from Note title`
    -   `Classify tag from Note FrontMatter`
    -   `Classify tag from Note Content`
    -   `Classify tag from Selected Area`

-   Toggle and choose from different **Tag Reference** types. The LLM will select the appropriate tag from these references:

    -   `All tags` (default)
    -   `Filtered Tags` with regular expression
    -   `Manual Tags` that are defined manually

-   Specify the **Output Type** from the response of the LLM:

    -   `#Tag`: at your `Current Cursor` or `Top of Content`
    -   `[[WikiLink]]`: at your `Current Cursor` or `Top of Content`
    -   `FrontMatter`: with `key`
    -   `Title Alternative`: at the end of note's title

-   (Optional) Add a `Prefix` or `Suffix` for the output format.

-   (Optional) You can use your custom request for your selected API:
    -   `Custom Prompt Template`
        -   The LLM will respond based on this prompt. The input coming from your Command will be replaced by `{{input}}`, and the reference tags you set will be placed in `{{reference}}`.
    -   `Custom Chat Role`
        -   You can guide the AI's behavior by setting this system role

## Classification Engines

## New: Generate Filenames for Notes

- Right-click a Markdown file in the File Explorer and choose "Generate filename (Auto Classifier)" to get a suggested filename based on the note's title and content.
- Or use the Command Palette: "Generate filename for current note".
- Currently supported with the OpenAI-compatible API path. If your engine is set to Jina AI, you'll get a notice that filename generation is not yet supported there.
- Suggestions are sanitized for filesystem safety and made unique within the target folder ("name 2.md", "name 3.md", ... if needed).


### OpenAI-compatible API
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom prompts and chat roles
- **Multiple Providers**: Works with OpenAI, Ollama, LocalAI, and other compatible APIs
- **Local AI Support**: Run models locally without internet connection
- **Recommended OpenAI models**: `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`
- **Advanced Features**: Custom prompt templates, system roles, and token control

### Jina AI Classifier
- **Cost-Effective**: Generous free tier with 10 million tokens
- **Multilingual**: Supports multiple languages including non-English content
- **High Performance**: Zero-shot classification with up to 8192 tokens input and 256 distinct classes
- **Optimized**: Works best with semantic labels (e.g., "happy", "sad", "angry")
- **Easy Setup**: Often no account creation required, can generate fresh API keys as needed

## Local AI Setup (Ollama, LocalAI)

**Experimental Support:**
‚ö†Ô∏è You may use local OpenAI-compatible APIs such as Ollama or LocalAI. However, support for these engines is experimental and full compatibility or stability is **not guaranteed**. Some features may not work as expected. Please test thoroughly before relying on these engines for important workflows.
If you encounter issues or want to help improve compatibility, **contributions and pull requests are very welcome!**

**Example setup:**
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) or [LocalAI](https://localai.io/)
2. Prepare your model: For Ollama, run `ollama pull llama3`. For LocalAI, configure your models as needed.
3. Set Base URL: Ollama - `http://localhost:11434/v1`, LocalAI - `http://localhost:8080/v1`
4. Set Model: e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`, etc.
5. API Key: Leave empty




## Example

### Use Case #1: **Selected area** &rightarrow; **Current cursor**

### Use Case #2: **Content** &rightarrow; **FrontMatter**

### Use Case #3: **FrontMatter** &rightarrow; **Title**

### DDC number classification

If you want to use this plugin for DDC number classification, edit the `Custom Prompt Template` like this:

```
Please use Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) to classify this content:
"""
{{input}}
"""
Answer format is JSON {reliability:0~1, output:"[ddc_number]:category"}.
Even if you are not sure, qualify the reliability and select one.
Convert the blank spaces to "_" in the output.
```

### LCSH classification

LCSH classification can be similar:

```
Please use Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) to classify this content:
"""
{{input}}
"""
Answer format is JSON {reliability:0~1, output:"[First LCSH term]--[Second LCSH term]--[Third LCSH term]"}.
Even if you are not sure, qualify the reliability and select one.
Convert the blank spaces to "_" in the output.
```
